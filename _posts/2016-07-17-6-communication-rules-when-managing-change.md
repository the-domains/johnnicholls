6 communication rules when managing change

Managing change is a complex process. Many fascinating books and theories have been created and I love reading (and implementing) some of the ideas. This is a short post focusing on six communication rules that are often overlooked but are crucial if you want your change at work to be successful. Regular communication - monthly, bi-weekly, weekly meetings (depending on the project) letting people know the current status of the project. Even telling people there is no news is better than silence - which often gets filled with rumours! Explain the reasons for the change. If people understand the rationale behind the change, they are more likely to invest in it. Often, even those opposed to the idea are likely to be less obstructive if they can identify with the reasons behind it. Value all opinions. Give everyone the chance to air their views and listen respectfully. Even if the viewpoints can't be accommodated, people have been listened to with respect. Early information is better than last minute. Try to ensure staff have the information before the public (in schools, I also mean the students and parents!) Opportunities to ask questions are always appreciated. If you don't know the answer, be honest. Let your colleagues know that you will try to find out, rather than have a guess! Equality - try to ensure, where possible, that all staff are given information at the same time. In schools, teaching assistants and support staff often find things out later than the teachers, even if it directly affects them more. This can cause bad feeling which can undermine your planned changes. Six simple ideas, not innovative, but important to remember when you are communicating your change initiatives.
