Leaders will show their gratitude to fellow colleagues because they honestly appreciate the great work of their team and they know it can be a powerful motivator. Things get complicated when you look at the theory of motivation. I have read that there are four types of motivation for workers. Not all your team will attach the same importance on each type: Financial - giving a money bonus for good work Gifts - rather than giving money, often a gift basket is valued instead Public praise - highlighting an individual's contribution to the wider team Private praise - thanking someone for a job well done privately on a one to one basis Getting this right isn't easy and you need to know your team well to pitch it perfectly every time. If this wasn't complicated enough, getting the praise balance right is tricky too. Praise too much and people may begin to doubt your sincerity, or devalue your opinion. Praise too little and colleagues may feel unappreciated. Finally, spontaneity plays a big part. I want to give an example of two different schools. In the first, For several years at Christmas time, the school principal used to give everyone a bottle of wine, gift wrap it and attach a signed card thanking them for their contribution. She did this out of her own pocket as the school budget was not healthy enough to support it. One Christmas, her financial situation meant she could not buy the present for the staff. She apologised and just sent out cards showing gratitude instead. Unfortunately, the kind gestures of the past were forgotten, some staff became quite angry and morale plummeted for the whole school. The principal was distraught at the hostility she received, especially after the good will she had previously shown. In a school just down the road, the school principal had a different approach. He never marked school holidays or public feasts with any public gestures. The staff could host their own event but it was up to the staff to generate it. However, once in a while, colleagues would enter the staff room and fresh doughnuts would be on the table with a written note saying "Thanks for your good work" - or the senior leadership team would supervise an extra break at the end of the day and give staff a chance to socialise or catch up on work. Other examples included leaving a chocolate bar in pigeon holes or having pizza delivered one lunchtime. All were spontaneous and unexpected. As a result of each event, staff morale improved and as it was fairly rare, it was never taken for granted. To conclude, showing gratitude to colleagues is not only an honorable way to work but is a powerful motivator too. My article is not meant to put you off praising others but to give you some aspects to reflect on for the year ahead.</p><picture>
