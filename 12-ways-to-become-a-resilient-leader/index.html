<p>12 ways to become a resilient leader</p><p>My children are amazed at how deprived my English childhood was. Back in the seventies, we only had two children’s TV channels, which would broadcast kids’ programmes for just two hours a day. One of the highpoints of these dark days was a programme called Crackerjack; a mad mix of badly acted dramas, party games and pop bands. A particular favourite game of mine was called “Double or Drop”, where children stood on a pedestal and answered topical general knowledge questions. For a correct answer, they received a prize which they had to hold. For a wrong answer, they had to hold a cabbage. As the prizes and cabbages tally got higher, the children had to cling on to the growing pile of goodies. If they dropped any, they were eliminated. The final winner was the child who held on to their prizes the longest. </p><p> In my work coaching hundreds of managers to become more resilient, I often think of that game. Many leaders find themselves clutching to all the professional and personal challenges that come their way. They think they are managing to keep afloat but then an unexpected cabbage comes their way and they fall apart. Often this leads to ill health, breakdown in relationships, professional underperformance and feeling a general unhappiness with life. I have guided many people in leadership positions to help them develop healthy habits and would like to share some great techniques to develop your resilience. </p><p> Confidence in your abilities </p><p>After the excitement of your promotion has worn out, often another emotion takes it place. When unfamiliar situations occur, you realise that you don’t really know what you are doing. You question your ability and begin to worry that others will find you out. This “Imposters” syndrome is something most people experience from time to time and can impact on their performance and wellbeing. To combat this, spend some time thinking about all your achievements. Every month, record your achievements at work and in your private life. See what impact you make to others and yourself. One colleague of mine kept a collection of scrap books, where she kept emails, cards and letters (she’d worked a long time!) from happy customers. Whenever she had a bad day or had doubts about her suitability as a manager, she would find a quiet space, sit down and read through all the positive things people had said about her. </p><p> Manage your energy, not your time </p><p>There are some great books on time management. Graham Allcott’s “How to be a Productivity Ninja” and David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” have helped me manage my time much more effectively. However, this is only part of the story. It is managing energy, not time that can really help you bounce through the tough times. Look at your schedule and find the times you are expending greater amounts of energy and then carve time out to enable you to indulge in activities that will recharge your vitality. I used to know a Director of a multi-national finance company, who managed a complex, stressful department but always managed to look fresh and relaxed. One day, I asked him his secret. Without embarrassment, he told me it was all due to model trains. In his attic, he had a working model railway, with accurately scaled scenery, people and of course, a central station. “I know people laugh at me”, he said, “but I don’t care. I come home from a tough day in the office, change my clothes and spend half an hour lost in my world of trains. Then I go downstairs, my day forgotten, and I can be human with my beautiful family.” </p><p> Keepers and Chuckers </p><p>Starting in a new management role is a great opportunity to look at your life and work out what you want to keep and what you would like to chuck. Obviously, there are things we might like to chuck, such as our mortgage or our city’s bad weather, which we may have to live with, but there are many habits or work routines that we have the chance to get rid of. Look at the activities that fill your day and decide which ones add to your values and enjoyment of life. See if the other activities still need to be done and if not, just don’t do them. Look and see which tasks can be delegated to others. If you have been a leader for some time, this exercise can be even more helpful. Look at the tasks that fill your day. Ask yourself which tasks are valuable to you, your values and your organisation. Can some of the other tasks be addressed through better processes, systems or through more effective delegation? </p><p> Find your rock </p><p>The most resilient executives I have coached have all had a fantastic relationship that has sustained them through the difficult periods of leadership. Sometimes, they have even been their wife or husband! Those lucky enough to have a warm, loving, supportive relationship are much better equipped to handle tough times at work. However, many people don’t have this but they find other people to be their rock. Perhaps a mentor from the same company, someone who shares the same interests or humour or an old college buddy. For some people, this relationship does not have to be tea, sympathy and tissues. I had one coaching client whose “rock” was his pool buddy. They would meet each Friday; have a couple of beers over a game of pocket billiards, insult each other’s sporting prowess and washing the strains of the week away in the process. Find the relationships that work for you. </p><p> Train yourself to be optimistic </p><p>This is harder for some than others, but the fact is optimistic people are more resilient than pessimists. When bad things happen, tell yourself they are temporary, that they could have happened to anyone and that you have survived worse events. When things are going well, enjoy the sunshine, tell yourself that you deserve this and that there will be many other times like this. Keep telling yourself these things until it becomes a habit. Challenge your negative thoughts by recognising them, finding ways to intellectually dispute them and then substituting them with the suggestions above.</p><p> Flexibility and letting go </p><p>In 2004, a great conflict broke out in the East of England. It is known in the local history books as “The Battle of the Straight Picture Frame.” For years, all the pictures have hung from my walls in an even, orderly manner. My lovely new wife moved in and her straight wasn’t my straight. Each day, I would restraighten her pictures and then when I went to work, she would restraighten my restraightening! It started quite harmlessly but over time, it became a big issue with us and led to serious arguments. Eventually, we realised that our goal was a loving, beautiful home and this focussing on a micro-issue was not helping us at all. Now that I have a house with four children, crooked pictures are the least of my worries! Being a leader is about achieving goals and it helps your staff if you let go of the reins and let them find their own way (with your guidance). Flexibility is a great skill to enhance your resilience. Since living in Hungary, I have often heard people talking about finding the kiskapu (translation: a little gate). Coined during the forty years of communist rule, the Hungarians have become expert in finding another way around a problem. Ignore the locked big door, find the small gate! </p><p> Decision Making </p><p>I have been told this story many times and apparently, it has been part of an academic study on decision making. A man visits a car showroom, falls in love with a car and then goes home to reflect on his choice. He then buys car magazines, reads the auto reviews and scours the internet to find out the qualities of the types of car would best suit his needs. Incredibly enough, all the research he carried out leads him to the conclusion that the car he set his heart on, was the best option for him. Sound familiar? We often make similar decisions at work and in our personal lives. Resilient leaders will find accurate data, check their assumptions and bias, use a decision making model that works for them and then finds a solution. If this becomes a good habit, in times of stress, we have an established habit to use rather than make ill-formed decisions that will come back and bite us. Or perhaps, we will be paralysed with indecision, which won’t help us either. </p><p> Kindness </p><p>Kindness is a powerful force. The world is so busy and people are so occupied with their lives and “to-do” lists, acts of kindness stand out like stars in a night sky. A deliberate or random act of kindness will make your employees love you more, but the research tells us that it makes us feel better too. Regularly reaching out to others makes us happier and healthier. So why do so many of us see the value of being kind to others but treat ourselves so harshly? How often have you turned to a loved one and said: “You idiot. You always mess up. How could you be so stupid?” How often have you said similar to yourself? Be gentle on yourself. Treat yourself with the same respect you strive to treat others with. Also, ask for help. Many of us like to give help and find it much harder to ask for the same. Once again, there is research that tells us that people like you more if they helped you. More so than if they have received the help from you instead. </p><p> Your values and passion </p><p>It is much easier to be resilient in times of difficulty if you are working to a greater goal which fits your values and passions. Ask yourself how your work fits your closely held values and what you would like your legacy to be. If you have never spent time exploring your values and life purpose, take time out to explore: your childhood dreams, the times you felt good at work and what triggered those good feelings and the times people have praised you. What attributes and talents did they praise? These should lead you to your purpose and values. </p><p> Control </p><p>Resilient leaders focus on the things they can control and minimise the importance of the rest. Not only is this a more effective way of working, it leads to much less stress. How often have you spent a sleepless night worrying about what people might think, the future of our loved ones or just the general state of the world? All things beyond our control. What we can influence is how we treat people, our interactions with our loved ones now, and perhaps making our small part of the world a better place. Effective leaders look to minimise the outside influences but pour their energies in the things they can control. </p><p> Keeping healthy </p><p>We all know that leading a healthy life will help us deal with stress and cope with life’s difficulties in a better way. Let’s just remind ourselves of the things we already know about healthy living: Drink lots of clean water Regular exercise, with appropriate rest days too Eat fresh food, cut down on the processed stuff 7 to 8 hours sleep a night Reduce the alcohol, say no to drugs Which one are you going to work on first? </p><p> Loving life </p><p>The essence of resilience is to love life, embracing its challenges and looking for new opportunities to grow. Find time to enjoy your cities and get out into nature. Value and feel gratitude for your relationships. Take opportunities to meet people who make you laugh, watch comedy shows and find the humour in life. Continue to learn new things and look for big and small adventures. </p><p> I hope that you find these twelve steps to be a valuable guide on your journey to being more resilient. By taking on a leadership role, you have a powerful impact on others as well as having great opportunities to develop and grow as a person. You owe it to yourself and your staff to grow strong in resilience so you can work together to create the legacy and impact you will be proud of.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

How often have you turned to a loved one and said: “You idiot. You always mess up. How could you be so stupid?” How often have you said similar to yourself? Be gentle on yourself. Treat yourself with the same respect you strive to treat others with. Also, ask for help. Many of us like to give help and find it much harder to ask for the same. Once again, there is research that tells us that people like you more if they helped you. More so than if they have received the help from you instead. </p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"5fa76065-bde7-4cf3-a32b-1a9c372ed09d","item":"8a3933b6-97e1-4518-b90b-d6946dbfdde2","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":" Your values and passion ","_html":"<p> Your values and passion </p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"daa846ef-a57a-4f17-a73b-ec780274140c","item":"8a3933b6-97e1-4518-b90b-d6946dbfdde2","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"It is much easier to be resilient in times of difficulty if you are working to a greater goal which fits your values and passions.
