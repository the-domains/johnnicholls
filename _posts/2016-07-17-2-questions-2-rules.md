  I have planned, compiled and delivered the findings of thousands of school
  employee surveys over the years. One of the most significant lessons for me is
  that better communication is the most popular “suggested improvement” for
  schools – in fact, it is twice as popular as any other item listed in the
  surveys. As a result, I have delivered communication workshops in hundreds of
  schools and worked with many staff groups to improve the way people share
  information & ideas. I have seen amazingly complex systems and both hi-tech
  and low-tech solutions, with mixed results. However, I am convinced that there
  is a simple way to ensure communication improves in your organization. It is
  the 2 questions, 2 rules method. First, list all the types of communication
  that your school needs. Here a few suggestions to start you off: long term,
  weekly, daily, information about children, management-staff sharing of ideas,
  last minute changes, emergency routines, part-time staff, parents …. 2
  questions For each type of communication, ask your staff to tell you; What’s
  working well? Suggestions for how to improve. Once you have found consensus
  with the staff, and have agreed what to keep, discard and implement, then put
  together an action plan. 2 rules Once you have implemented the plans that all
  employees have agreed to, then they must adhere to 2 rules. A Communication is
  everyone’s responsibility. This means people should pro-actively seek
  communication (rather than expect others to supply it) B Everyone has the
  responsibility to use the agreed communication methods. There is no point
  creating a new communication strategy if people aren’t committed to using the
  systems provided. There are no excuses. Almost all schools that have applied
  this technique, using the 2 questions and 2 rules method, have improved their
  communication processes. I encourage you to give it a try.
